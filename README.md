# An interactive online deck of cards to play Welcome To

View it here: https://benwalk.github.io/welcome-to. Some instructions, if you're too cautious to tinker around:

- **Randomize** randomly picks a level 1, level 2, and level 3 city plan card. This could be the same one.
- Clicking a plan card's point values will allow you to mark it as done. This does not reset if you randomize.
- **Flip** moves the three face-up cards to the bottom row and reveals the effect on the "back" of the card.
- **Un-Flip** does the opposite.
- There are indicators that denote how many sets of three cards are left in the deck, purely to help track if you've flipped or not. I'm not sure if knowing this is strictly allowed or even called out in the rulebook.
- **Shuffle** is allowed when there are no more cards to flip. As we need to keep the final set flipped to continue the game, all cards except the last three are shuffled into new "draw piles."

There is no persistence whatsoever, so _refreshing the page will reset everything_. You've been warned.

# About The Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizes [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for the components.

I hacked this together with some spare time and a desire to teach myself some fun stuff that I'll actually use, and I fully realize it may not be mobile responsive. The images are most definitely not sized appropriately, and you might see latency as a result. Sorry.
